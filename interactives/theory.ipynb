    "Gardner et al. assumed that the microtubule catatrophe times are gamma distributed. The gamma distribution models the time we have to wait for $\\alpha$ arrivals of a Poisson process, where each subprocess occurs at the same rate $\\beta$. As Justin says, \"Chemical processes are often modeled as Poisson processes, and one can imagine that it may take several successive chemical processes to trigger a catastrophe event. If these processes all have similar rates, the time to catastrophe could be approximately Gamma distributed\" (quoted from solutions). Interestingly, even though arrivals are often thought of as integer values, the gamma distribution is continuous and can take on any positive real number. As such, there may be something like $\\alpha = 2.4$ arrivals, and the average catastrophe time would be $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}$. The gamma model is well defined, and models of it can be found on [Justin's Distribution Explorer](https://distribution-explorer.github.io/continuous/gamma.html).\n",

    "As an alternate model, we propose \"that exactly two biochemical processes have to happen in succession to trigger catastrophe. That is, the first process happens, and only after the first process happens can the second one happen. We model each of the two process as a Poisson process. The rate of arrivals for the first one is $\\beta_1$ and the rate of arrivals for the second one is $\\beta_2$\" (quoted from homework problem). In other words, the time to each arrival individually is exponentially distributed, and the sum of the two arrival times is the catastrophe time. We can explore how this idea visually by randomly generating points out of the joint exponential distribution and varying our $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ parameter values. We use the [viz_explore_two_arrival_story.py](https://liuvictoria.github.io/sleepingbeauty/software/viz_explore_two_arrival_story.py) module to generate Figure 2a."

    "We see that when $\\beta_2$ is much larger than $\\beta_1$, the catastrophe times are much shorter, since having a high rate of arrival for the second event makes the first event the 'limiting step' of the story, and catastrophe can happen very soon after the first event has arrived. On the other hand, when $\\beta_2$ is much smaller than $\\beta_1$, the catastrophe times are longer, reflecting the fact that the second event takes a while, and it can only happen after the first event has arrived. Of interest, especially in the smaller values of catastrophe times, the distributions all have inflection points. This is different from exponential distributions, which do not.\n",

As such, we model the probability density functions of $t_1$ and $t_2$ as follows: $f(t_1) = \\beta_1 \\mathrm{e}^{(-\\beta_1 t_1)}$ and $f(t_2) = \\beta_2 \\mathrm{e}^{(-\\beta_2 t_2)}$. \n",

    "As an initial guess for the gamma distribution $\\alpha$, we estimate that there will be around $2$ arrivals. We choose $2$ mostly because we will later be modeling based on a two biochemical process story. In addition, chemically, it might be difficult to require a large number of arrivals to occur before catastrophe, since each successive arrival would make the overall chance for getting catastrophe lower and lower; and, as we've seen in previous problems, catastrophe is not a _particularly_ rare event. As seen in the confidence intervals, the gamma distribution suggests that there are around $2.4$ arrivals, with a $95$% confidence interval of $[1.98242, 2.91772]$. Chemically, it sounds something funky may be going on. Perhaps there are two different populations of the microtubules, and there might be some mixture modeling going on, thus giving us a non-integer $alpha$. Or, maybe dimerization may affect the number of average arrivals, if one arrival might affect multiple microtubules. There may be other better explanations as well. The $beta$ is $0.00546287$ and represents the arrival rate, which suggests that it takes approximately $183$ seconds for one arrival to come.While the confidence interval plots look nice, since we have two parameters, it would more informative to look at a corner plot, since that way we can tell how different values of $alpha$ and $beta$ vary with each other, and what values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ pairs are within the $95$% confidence interval. We see this in Figure 3b."

    "Not surprisingly, we see that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are positively correlated; this makes sense because the more arrivals there are, the faster each arrival would have to come within the catastrophe timeframe; thus, we cannot have a large $\\alpha$ with a small $\\beta$. Interestingly for the $95$% confidence region, values of $\\alpha$ generally fall between $2$ and $3$, while $\\beta$ falls between $0.0045$ and $0.007$. This suggests that there are between $2$ and $3$ arrivals. Now, we plot the confidence intervals for the two story distribution parameters, as seen in Figure 3c."

    "The confidence interval for $\\beta_1$ is $[0.003261, 0.004538]$, while $\\beta_2$'s is $[0.004147, 0.008550]$. We mentioned previously that $\\beta_1$'s MLE is $0.0045381223$, while $\\beta_2$'s MLE is $0.0045381285$, both in inverse seconds. This is interesting, because our MLE essentially collapses down to a gamma distribution with $\\alpha = 2$. In other words, given our set of catastrophe times, it is difficult to wheedle out what portion of the time is before to the arrival of the first event, and what portion of the time is between the first and second event. It also makes sense that the confidence intervals show $\\beta_2$ as being greater in value than $\\beta_1$, since we originally enforced that $\\beta_2 \\ge \\beta_1$. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see that the MLEs still have them finding each other at the same values. Let's also make a corner plot between $\\beta_1$ and $\\Delta \\beta$ to see how $\\beta_1$ and $\\Delta \\beta$ are correlated, as seen in Figure 3d."

Nevertheless, we still see that as $\\beta_2$ decreases, $\\beta_1$ increases, which makes sense given that the total time for arrival was optimized to match that of the emperical catastrophe times. Now, we've done enough theoretical parameter estimates type analysis, and we are ready to graduate to model comparison in the next section."
