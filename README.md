# Microtubule Catastrophe
In this repository, we model microtubule catastrophe times with two different models, at five different concentrations. The repo contains the data (graciously provided by [Gardner et al](https://cbs.umn.edu/gardner-lab/home)), code, figures, and analysis for BeBi103 Fall 2020 @Caltech.

The website exists :crown:[here](https://liuvictoria.github.io/sleepingbeauty/):crown:. 


The team consists of Victoria Liu, Sara Adams, Ruby Cheetham, and Makayla Betts
