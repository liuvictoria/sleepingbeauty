# Microtubule Catastrophe
In this repository, we model microtubule catastrophe times with two different models, at five different concentrations. The repo contains the data (graciously provided by [Gardner et al](https://cbs.umn.edu/gardner-lab/home)), code, figures, and analysis for BeBi103 Fall 2020 @Caltech.

The website exists :crown:[here](https://liuvictoria.github.io/sleepingbeauty/):crown:.


The team consists of Victoria Liu, Sara Adams, Ruby Cheetham, and Makayla Betts.


This repository is called sleepingbeauty because Aurora also had a spindle catastrophe :crown: :european_castle: :dizzy: :sleeping: :eyes: :dancer:

#### `microtubulepkg`
Python scripts with all the functions we used to analyze and plot the data; made to be pip-installabale

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank Gardner et al. for making their hard-earned data public so that we could explore and visualize it. We are also indebted to the bebi103 course staff for answering all our questions and giving us support throughout the term. Next, huge shoutout to Griffin Chure for this [awesome reproducible website template](https://github.com/gchure/reproducible_website) and the open source community in general for answering our code-related questions. Finally, we would like to thank Justin Bois for creating this fun, occasionally frustrating, but highly rewarding class.
